### Description
USAT (Unified Score-based Association Test) uses a data-adaptive weighted score-based test statistic for testing association of multiple continuous phenotypes with a single genetic marker. The R function `usat` implements this association test. For details of this statistical method, please refer/cite:

### Usage

#### Simple example
```{r}
usat(Y, X, COV=NULL, na.check=TRUE, na.check.msg=TRUE, manova.out=FALSE, AbsTol=.Machine$double.epsË†0.8)
```
#### Arguments
| Input | Description |
| ---: | --- |
| `Y` | The `nxK` phenotype matrix, where `n` is the number of individuals and `K` is the number of phenotypes. The joint association of all `K`  phenotypes with the single marker will be tested. `Y` needs to be in R matrix format. |
| `X` | The `nx1` column matrix for the single genetic marker, where `n` is the number of individuals. `X` needs to be in R matrix format. |
| `COV` | The `nxq` matrix of covariates that need to be adjusted in the model. `q` is the number of such covariates. `COV` needs to be in R matrix format. The default value is NULL, i.e., it is assumed there is no covariate in the model. |
| `na.check` | If value is TRUE (default), the code will check for presence of missing values (coded as `NA`). USAT requires complete observations and any individual with at least one missing value in either `Y`, `X` or `COV` will be removed. Removal of missing observations may substantially reduce the sample size `n` and hence power to detect association. If a substantial proportion of the individuals have missing data, it is recommended (if possible) to impute the missing values before using USAT. |
| `na.check.msg` | If value is TRUE (default), user will receive message updates when presence of missing values (coded as `NA`) is checked. |
| `manova.out` | If value is FALSE (default), MANOVA statistic and p-value will not be included in the final output. |
| `AbsTol` | The user can specify the absolute tolerance value used in the numerical integration for evaluating USAT p-values. Default value is 3e-13. `integrate()` function is used for numerical integration. |

#### Value
| Output | Description |
| ---: | --- |
| `T.usat` | The value of the USAT test statistic (scalar). |
| `omg.opt` | The optimal weight $\omega$ based on a grid search over [0, 1]. |
| `p.usat` | The p-value of association based on the USAT statistic. |
| `n.obs` | Number of individuals (with complete observations) used for testing association. |
| `T.manova` | The value of the MANOVA test statistic (scalar). Provided if `manova.out=TRUE`. |
| `p.manova` | The p-value of association based on MANOVA statistic. Provided if `manova.out=TRUE`. |


### A Working Example
```
source("usat_v1.21.R")

# simulate 2 phenotypes on 1000 individuals
library(MASS) # needed for multivariate normal simulation
Y<-mvrnorm(n=1000, mu=c(0,0), Sigma=matrix(c(1,0.2,0.2,1),2,2))

# simulate a single marker for 1000 individuals
X<-matrix(rbinom(n=1000, size=2, prob=0.2), ncol=1) # additive model

# apply USAT to test association
u.out<-usat(Y=Y, X=X, COV=NULL, na.check=FALSE)

# USAT test statistic and p-value
t<-u.out$T.usat
p<-u.out$p.usat
```

### Notes
1. The method USAT and its software is designed for multiple continuous phenotypes from a random sample. If the ascertainment of individuals in the sample is non-random (e.g., in case-control retrospective study design), it is advisable to account for the sampling scheme (e.g., adjusting the sampling variable as a covariate) when using USAT. One may also use methods and tools designed specifically for the analysis of secondary phenotypes. We proposed one such method ([POM-PS](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gepi.22045/full)) and its [software](https://github.com/RayDebashree/POM-PS) is publicly available.

2. Although USAT software can adjust for covariates, it is advisable to perform covariate adjustments and necessary transformations (e.g., inverse-normal transformation) on the traits and then apply USAT on the residuals. This will speed up total computation time.

3. The method USAT and its software is designed for unrelated individuals. If you have two cohorts with overlapping samples and you want to analyse the combined sample, it is desirable to exclude the overlapping individuals, and any related individuals. 

4. If you receive an error like `the integral is probably divergent`, try reducing the absolute tolerance parameter `AbsTol`.
 
5. If you wish to test genetic association of multiple traits (categorical and/or continuous) and you have access to summary statistics only, please use the new software [metaUSAT](https://github.com/RayDebashree/metaUSAT) that is publicly available now!
